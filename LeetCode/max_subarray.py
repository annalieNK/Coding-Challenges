# Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

# For example, given the array [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
# the contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

## compare each new sum with the previous sum: 
# set previous sum as the first integer
# compare current sum with the previous integer
# compare current sum with maximum sum so far
